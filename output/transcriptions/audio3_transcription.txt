 I hope to be around the day we grasp into the future. The nature of mind befriending time and truth. In a middle way I stand, warm and eastward, longing to come home again. Walking through these streets I know too well, but my thoughts stray away. I dream of my future, remote from time bound, becoming myself without any end. I dream of my future, remote from time bound, becoming myself and true. I wander at this light, enclosed in our soul and truth. And bid our clay remain, soft as it is and truth. In a middle way I stand, warm and eastward, longing to come home again. Walking through these streets I know too well, but my thoughts stray away. I dream of my future, remote from time bound, becoming myself without any end. I dream of my future, remote from time bound, becoming myself and true. I dream of my future, remote from time bound, becoming myself without any end. I dream of my future, remote from time bound, becoming myself and true. I dream of my future, remote from time bound, becoming myself and true.
